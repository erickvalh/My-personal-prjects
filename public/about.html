<h1>About Me</h1>

<h4>Personal Life</h4>
<p>About my personal life, I like to play guitar, play videogames, hang out with my friends. I don't know is because of my age, but I like to watch news
  in the morning and in the evening.
</p>
<h4>My professional experience</h4>
<p>About my work experience, in 2016 I started working on a printing house as general assistant, I worked there for about 6 months,
  I learned to use several cutting machines. <br/>
  Then, the same year I joined to a company called Sykes, which is a call center as a Sales Rep. I started in a spanish campaing, then I moved to a bilingual (esp/eng) campaing, working there for AT&T
  for aroung 6 months. Then the campaing ended and I was moved to Tupperware where I worked for 3 years and 6 months. I was promoted to the supervisor position in the same campaing, where I worked for 1 year and 6 months. <br/>
  Then I was hired by AT&T directly where I worked from August 2020 to October 2022, at the same time I was working for another startup as a Project Manager.
</p>
<h4>My current experience</h4>
<p>Currently I am working in a excellent start up called Contensive. Currently I've worked for 6 months in here as Customer Success Advocate. It's been really exiting to lear something new every day from the team. I'm expecting to grow my career in this job.</p>
